# CodeSamples

This repository contains a few code samples from some of the games featured in my showreel.

Currently all featured code is either C# or C++. All C# code was written in the context of the Unity Engine
and the C++ was written with DirectX10. 

Of the three game demos featured here, two are 2D from both a side-on and top-down perspective and one is 3D from a FPS perspective.
