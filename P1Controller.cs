/*
This code was written in C# with Unity

This is a small part of the source code for Smack N Crack
This sample file is the player controller script that allows
the player to move their paddle and fire projectiles.
It moves the paddle with a physics-based movement system and
contains logic that prevents the player from moving off the screen
and for reacting to the collision of enemy projectiles.
